      <h2>Where can I learn more?</h2>
      <p>fccBot was created by members of the <a href="https://tropicalchancer.github.io/projectus/">Chingu Cohorts</a> - student programmers learning together. The fccBot is not part of the freeCodeCamp project and was not created or endorsed by freeCodeCamp - but we like to think they'd approve.</p>
      <p>To learn more about fccBot, check out the <a href="https://github.com/AgathaLynn/rhino-bot-project">GitHub repository</a> for the fccBot project.</p>
